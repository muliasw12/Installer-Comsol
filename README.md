# multipole decomposition and resonance contribution from SIE program
This program is used to calculate the multipole decomposition of electric and magnetic fields in solid dielectric objects and to calculate the contribution of multipole resonances.

Use runner.m file to calculate multipole decomposition and resonance.m to calculate contribution of multipole resonances

All files must be in the same folder
